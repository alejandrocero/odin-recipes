        <li>1 Pound beef</li>
        <li>3/4 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>Dried oregano</li>
        <li>2 cups refried beans</li>
        <li>4 large flour tortillas</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3><br>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place a skillet over medium heat. <br>
            Cook and stir ground beef, 1/2 cup chopped onion, and garlic in the hot skillet until <br>
            beef is browned and crumbly, breaking it apart as it cooks, about 8 minutes; drain excess grease. <br>
            Mix in 1/2 of the can diced tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, paprika, oregano, <br>
            3/4 teaspoon cumin, and black pepper. Bring meat mixture to a boil over medium-high heat and cook for 5 minutes, <br>
            stirring often. </li>
        <li>Heat refried beans and remaining 1/4 teaspoon cumin in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Keep beans warm. <br>
            Mix remaining diced tomatoes, beef gravy, and enchilada sauce in a separate saucepan; bring to a boil. </li>
        <li>Place tortillas onto a microwave-safe plate and cover with a damp paper towel; <br>
            microwave tortillas until they are soft and warm, about 30 seconds. </li>
        <li>Place warmed tortilla onto a work surface and spoon 1/4 of the beef mixture in a line down the center. <br>
            Layer 1/4 of the bean mixture on top of beef layer and spread 1/4 cup of the Cheddar cheese over the bean layer. <br>
            Fold right and left edges of tortilla over the ends of the filling and roll up tortilla to make a burrito. <br>
            Place burrito, seam side down, into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas to make 4 burritos. </li>
        <li>Pour gravy sauce over burritos in the baking dish; top with remaining 1 cup Cheddar cheese. </li>
        <li>Bake burritos in the preheated oven until cheese has melted, 15 to 20 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
